Kenken:

A simple GUI program that allows the user to play a 6x6 kenken game.

To install:

Ensure that SDL2 and SDL_ttf are installed on your system. See https://www.libsdl.org/ and https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ for more info.

Clone this repository, and run "make all". This will create an executable "kenken".

Note: this game was made entirely for my own development as a programmer, and is definitely still a work in progress.
