Design Task: Create a Kenken generator

Goal: Create a tool to generate new KenKens that are valid KenKens and which can be solved.

Components:
- Gui
-- Show Ken Ken
-- Let user enter numbers
-- Show solution
-- Check solution
- Structure for generating Kenkens *DONE
- Structure for solving Kenkens given input
- Valid_KENKEN: Return 1 if a KENKEN is valid, 0 otherwise




A KenKen is:
	- 36 squares (store values in 2D array)
	- the numbers 1-6 in each row and column
	- up to 36 conditions
	- Each condition is a structure with a
		- linked list of values, positions
		- an operation and a value for said operation
		- the edges of a condition must touch another square within the same condition
	- single square conditions have no operation (null)
	- minus and division conditions must have only 2 arguments
	- A division condition must return 0 under any mod function 

Random Generation Algorithm
	- Must first (randomly) generate a valid grid
	- (this guarantees that the puzzle will have at least 1 solution)
	- Must then (randomly) generate a list of constraints
	
Grid Algorithm:
	- For each square:
		- moving first left, then down, Check available numbers
			- create list/array from 1-6
			- check all squares to left
			- for each number in such a square, remove it from the available numbers
			- check all squares above
			- as above
		- randomly select number from available numbers

Constraint Algorithm:
- List of free squares
- create:
	- 1 4-square (randomly assign addition or multiplication)
	- 4 3-squares (as above)
	- create 2 squares until no more are possible
	- create 1 squares
- to create a constraint:
	-randomly add squares to constraint, using a walk algorithm
	-based on the number of squares, randomly select an operation
	-take list of squares and values, and use this alongside the operation to generate the result
	-add constraint to the list of constraints
	
GUI
Task 1:
- Create a window which displays a valid Kenken
- Create a 7x7 array of points, with positions based on window sizes
- Create a 7x6 array of vertical edges (1/0 for boundary/non boundary)
- Create a 6x7 array of horizontal edges
- For each constraint:
	- Take cell value
	- Add vertical edges to a vertical edge list
	- Add horizontal edges to a horizontal edge list
	- Check to see if a V element occurs more than once. If so, set V edge to 0. Else, do nothing.
